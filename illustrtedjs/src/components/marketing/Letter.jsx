      <p>Hey, thanks for visiting!</p>
      <p>
        If only you could know how amazing it feels to see that YOU landed on
        our little slice of the internet.
      </p>
      <p>
        Illustrated JS was founded on the principles that learning a language
        and passing the coding interview should be accessible to everyone,
        regardless of your learning style.
      </p>
      <p>
        Too often the resources available seem like they were designed for other
        people. We were tired of searching through Youtube, Udemy and Google. We
        just wanted everything in front of us.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our commitment to you is that the hardest part of learning JavaScript
        moving forward will be learning JavaScript. Our course's are built so
        that everything you need is located in one central place. No more
        searching the web, jumping from video to video on Youtube or investing
        in courses that do not deliver.
      </p>
      <p>
        From here, we recommend scrolling down and checking out what we offer.
      </p>
      <p>Hope to see you on the platform,</p>
      <p>- The Illustrated JS Team</p>
